## Features
- **File Browsing**:
  - Navigate through your device's external storage with a clean, folder-based interface.
  - Supports navigation to parent directories using the back button.
  - Displays files and folders in a `RecyclerView` with icons for easy identification.

- **File Operations**:
  - **Copy/Move Files**: Copy or move files and folders to different directories using a context menu.
  - **Delete Files**: Delete files or folders with a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion.
  - **Rename Files**: Rename files or folders directly from the context menu.
  - **File Details**: View detailed information about a file, including its name, path, size, and last modified date (available as a fallback when a file cannot be opened).

- **Sorting**:
  - Sort files and folders by multiple criteria: name, size, date modified, or file type.
  - Supports ascending and descending order for each sorting criterion.
  - Directories are always displayed before files for better organization.

  - **Recursive Search**: Search for files not only in the current directory but also in all subdirectories.
  - **Advanced Filters**:
    - Filter search results by file type (e.g., "txt", "pdf", "jpg").
    - Filter by file size (e.g., "< 1 MB", "1-10 MB", "> 10 MB").
    - Filter by date modified (e.g., "Today", "This Week", "Older").
  - **Highlight Matches**: The matching portion of the file name is highlighted in orange in the search results.
  - **Debounced Search**: A 300ms delay is applied to search filtering to improve performance during rapid typing.
  - Displays the full file path for search results from subdirectories to help identify file locations.

- **File Opening**:
